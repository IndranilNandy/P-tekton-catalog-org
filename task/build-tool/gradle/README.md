# Description

## Usage

### Enabling 'fast build' setup

Use this setup to speed up code build by enabling-

1. gradle dependency caching (e-gradle-user-home-cache),
2. caching build-binary (e-gradle-project-build-cache),
3. supporting gradle incremental tasks (e-gradle-project-local-cache).

As of now due to some tekton variable substitution limitations E_FAST_BUILD_SUPPORT flag CAN NOT BE USED as a single point switch/entry to enable.

Need to follow these steps to enable all caching and features.

    a. Set E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM as a location outside of the source-repo root directory.
       REMEMBER this location should NOT be a sub-directory of project root.
       In that case git-clone task will erase it (build) every time, and gradle incremental task will not be effective.
       e.g. E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM=/tmp/project/build-artifacts
    b. Pass -PbuildDir=<custom-build-dir-loc> to TASKS params of gradle task. (see samples)
    c. Need to EXPLICITLY PASS all the three workspaces (static pvc) to enable all features and caching.
            - e-gradle-user-home-cache
            - e-gradle-project-build-cache
            - e-gradle-project-local-cache

### Enabling 'fresh build' setup

Use this setup for a fresh clean build scenario.

    a. DO NOT PASS the following two workspaces.
            - e-gradle-project-build-cache
            - e-gradle-project-local-cache
    b.  e-gradle-user-home-cache is MANDATORY. But, you may pass a 'dynamic pvc' to ensure that the cache dependencies are always downloaded afresh.
    c. E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM has no effect (hence, no need to pass), since we are not passing it using -PbuildDir to TASKS param of gradle task.

## Purpose of params

### E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM

By default, gradle builds and stores binary in the 'build' folder of the project root folder.

But, since git-clone task by default cleans the workspace along with the 'build' folder, gradle incremental tasks doesn't work to speed up the build.

For faster build, we need to store the 'built binary' outside of the project root folder and mount it on other workspace.

    1. Set E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM (e.g. /tmp/project/build-artifacts/build)
    2. Pass '-PbuildDir=<custom-build-dir-location>' to TASKS parameter of gradle task.
    3. e-gradle-project-build-cache will automatically mount E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM.

## Purpose of workspaces

### e-gradle-project-build-cache

        [OPTIONAL]
        - Mounts E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM.
        - Use this for FAST BUILD setup.
        - Holds project build to speed up successive builds using gradle incremental task.
        - Use this for usecases like caching build binaries to speed up 'gradle build' when you aren't using 'gradle clean build'
          This has to be done in conjunction with passing -PbuildDir=<custom-build-dir-location> to TASKS parameter of gradle task.
        - DO NOT SUPPLY THIS WORKSPACE from TaskRun/PipelineRun if you want to BUILD AFRESH.
        - Remember that if you don't pass -PbuildDir=<custom-build-dir-location>, and you provide this workspace, it will be mounted on E_PROJECT_BUILD_DIR_CUSTOM.
          But, the gradle build-binary will NOT be stored in this location, rather in PROJECT_DIR/build folder.
          So, effectively this workspace will NOT HOLD the build binary.

### e-gradle-project-local-cache

        [OPTIONAL]
        - Mounts local .gradle folder of the project.
        - Use this for FAST BUILD setup.
        - Holds project specific cache directory (.gradle) generated by Gradle.
          This is needed along with e-gradle-project-build-cache to support incremental task.
        - Use this for usecases like speeding up gradle build using incremental tasks.
        - DO NOT SUPPLY THIS WORKSPACE from TaskRun/PipelineRun if you want to BUILD AFRESH.
        - Remember that if you don't pass -PbuildDir=<custom-build-dir-location>, and you provide this workspace, project specific .gradle will be cached.
          But, since gradle build-binary is NOT effectively cached (see e-gradle-project-build-cache) in this case, 'incremental tasks' will NOT be effective.

### e-gradle-user-home-cache

        [OPTIONAL]
        - Mounts E_GRADLE_USER_HOME
        - Use this for FAST BUILD setup.
        - This is the global .gradle location.
        - Stores global configuration properties, initialization scripts, caches, and log files.
        - Use this for usecases like caching gradle dependencies.
        - Since this is mandatory gradle dependencies will be cached always, and it'll speed up build unless dynamic pvc is passed.
